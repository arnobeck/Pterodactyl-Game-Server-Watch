# Pterodactyl Game Server Watch

## Description
A tool programmed in Go to automatically restart 'hung' (game) servers via the Pterodactyl API (working since version 1.4.2). This only supports servers that respond to the [A2S_INFO](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries#A2S_INFO) query (a Valve Master Server query). I am currently looking for a better way to detect if a server is hung, though.

## Command Line Flags
There is only one command line argument/flag and it is `-cfg=<path>`. This argument/flag changes the path to the Pterowatch config file. The default value is `/etc/pterowatch/pterowatch.conf`.

Examples include:

```
./pterowatch -cfg=/home/cdeacon/myconf.conf
./pterowatch -cfg=~/myconf.conf
./pterowatch -cfg=myconf.conf
```

## Config File
The config file's default path is `/etc/pterowatch/pterowatch.conf` (this can be changed with a command line argument/flag as seen above). This should be a JSON array including the API URL, token, and an array of servers to check against. The main options are the following:

* `apiurl` => The Pterodactyl API URL (do not include the `/` at the end).
* `token` => The bearer token (from the client) to use when sending requests to the Pterodactyl API.
* `apptoken` => The bearer token (from the application) to use when sending requests to the Pterodactyl API (this is only needed when `addservers` is set to `true`).
* `debug` => The debug level (1-4).
* `reloadtime` => If above 0, will reload the configuration file and retrieve servers from the API every *x* seconds.
* `addservers` => Whether or not to automatically add servers to the config from the Pterodactyl API.
* `defenable` => The default enable boolean of a server added via the Pterodactyl API.
* `defscantime` => The default scan time of a server added via the Pterodactyl API.
* `defmaxfails` => The default max fails of a server added via the Pterodactyl API.
* `defmaxrestarts` => The default max restarts of a server added via the Pterodactyl API.
* `defrestartint` => The default restart interval of a server added via the Pterodactyl API.
* `defreportonly` => The default report only boolean of a server added via the Pterodactyl API.
* `defmentions` => The default mentions JSON for servers added via the Pterodactyl API.
* `servers` => An array of servers to watch (read below).
* `misc` => An array of misc options (read below).

## Egg Variable Overrides
If you have the `addservers` setting set to true (servers are automatically retrieved via the Pterodactyl API), you may use the following egg variables as overrides to the specific server's config.

* `PTEROWATCH_DISABLE` => If set to above 0, will disable the specific server from the tool.
* `PTEROWATCH_IP` => If not empty, will override the server IP to scan with this value for the specific server.
* `PTEROWATCH_PORT` => If not empty, will override the server port to scan with this value for the specific server.
* `PTEROWATCH_SCANTIME` => If not empty, will override the scan time with this value for the specific server.
* `PTEROWATCH_MAXFAILS` => If not empty, will override the maximum fails with this value for the specific server.
* `PTEROWATCH_MAXRESTARTS` => If not empty, will override the maximum restarts with this value for the specific server.
* `PTEROWATCH_RESTARTINT` => If not empty, will override the restart interval with this value for the specific server.
* `PTEROWATCH_REPORTONLY` => If not empty, will override report only with this value for the specific server.
* `PTEROWATCH_MENTIONS` => If not empty, will override the mentions JSON string with this value for the specific server.

## Server Options/Array
This array is used to manually add servers to watch. The `servers` array should contain the following items:

* `name` => The server's name.
* `enable` => If true, this server will be scanned.
* `ip` => The IP to send A2S_INFO requests to.
* `port` => The port to send A2S_INFO requests to.
* `uid` => The server's Pterodactyl UID.
* `scantime` => How often to scan a game server in seconds.
* `maxfails` => The maximum amount of A2S_INFO response failures before attempting to restart the game server.
* `maxrestarts` => The maximum amount of times we attempt to restart the server until A2S_INFO responses start coming back successfully.
* `restartint` => When a game server is restarted, the program won't start scanning the server until *x* seconds later.
* `reportonly` => If set, only debugging and misc options will be executed when a server is detected as down (e.g. no restart).
* `mentions` => A JSON string that parses all custom role and user mentions inside of web hooks for this server.

## Server Mentions Array
The server `mentions` JSON string's parsed JSON output includes a `data` list with each item including a `role` (boolean indicating whether we're mentioning a role) and `id` (the ID of the role or user in string format).

Here are some examples:

```JSON
{
        "data": [
                {
                        "role": true,
                        "id": "1293959919293959192"
                },
                {
                        "role": false,
                        "id": "1959192351293954123"
                }
        ]
}
```

This is what it looks like inside of the mentions string.

```JSON
{
        "servers": [
                {
                        "mentions": "{\"data\":[{\"role\": true,\"id\": \"1293959919293959192\"},{\"role\": false,\"id\": \"1959192351293954123\"}]}"
                }
        ]
}
```

The above will replace the `{MENTIONS}` text inside of the web hook's contents with `<@&1293959919293959192>, <@1959192351293954123>`.

## Misc Options/Array
This tool supports misc options which are configured under the `misc` array inside of the config file. The only event supported for this at the moment is when a server is restarted from the tool. However, other events may be added in the future. An example may be found below.

```JSON
{
        "misc": [
                {
                        "type": "misctype",
                        "data": {
                                "option1": "val1",
                                "option2": "val2"
                        }
                }
        ]
}
```

### Web Hooks
As of right now, the only misc option `type` is `webhook` which indicates a web hook. The `app` data item represents what type of application the web hook is for (the default value is `discord`).

Please look at the following data items:

* `app` => The web hook's application (either `discord` or `slack`).
* `url` => The web hook's URL (**REQUIRED**).
* `contents` => The contents of the web hook.
* `username` => The username the web hook sends as (**only** Discord).
* `avatarurl` => The avatar URL used with the web hook (**only** Discord).
* `mentions` => An array including a `roles` item as a boolean allowing custom role mentions and `users` item as a boolean allowing custom user mentions.

**Note** - Please copy the full web hook URL including `https://...`.

#### Variable Replacements For Contents
The following strings are replaced inside of the `contents` string before the web hook submission.

* `{IP}` => The server's IP.
* `{PORT}` => The server's port.
* `{FAILS}` => The server's current fail count.
* `{RESTARTS}` => The amount of times the server has been restarted since down.
* `{MAXFAILS}` => The server's configured max fails.
* `{MAXRESTARTS}` => The server's configured max restarts.
* `{UID}` => The server's UID from the config file/Pterodactyl API.
* `{SCANTIME}` => The server's configured scan time.
* `{RESTARTINT}` => The server's configured restart interval.
* `{NAME}` => The server's name.
* `{MENTIONS}` => If there are mentions, it will print them in `<id>, ...` format in this replacement.

#### Defaults
Here are the Discord web hook's default values.

* `contents` => \*\*SERVER DOWN\*\*\\n- \*\*Name\*\* => {NAME}\\n- \*\*IP\*\* => {IP}:{PORT}\\n- \*\*Fail Count\*\* => {FAILS}/{MAXFAILS}\\n- \*\*Restart Count\*\* => {RESTARTS}/{MAXRESTARTS}\\n\\nScanning again in \*{RESTARTINT}\* seconds...
* `username` => Pterowatch
* `avatarurl` => *empty* (default)

        ]
}
```

## Building
You may use `git` and `go build` to build this project and produce a binary. I'd suggest cloning this to `$GOPATH` so there aren't problems with linking modules. For example:

```bash
# Clone repository.
git clone https://github.com/gamemann/Pterodactyl-Game-Server-Watch.git

# Change directory to respository.
cd Pterodactyl-Game-Server-Watch/

# Build, which should automatically download needed files.
go build -o pgsw
```

## Using Makefile To Build And Install
You may use `make` and `sudo make install` to build and install the project's executable to `/usr/bin` (in `$PATH` by default normally). This also copies a `Systemd` service called `pgsw.service`.

See below for examples.

```bash
# Build project into `./pgsw` executable.
make

# Install Systemd service and file to /usr/bin/.
sudo make install

# Enable and start service (will start on bootup).
sudo systemctl enable --now pgsw
```
